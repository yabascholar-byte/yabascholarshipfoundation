        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
            The Yabá Educational Foundation was founded in 2017 by Gigi Tibi, whose family roots are in Iriga City, Camarines Sur. Moved by a deep commitment to inclusive education, she began the Foundation with her own seed fund and the support of friends who believed, as she did, that education can break the cycle of poverty and marginalization. Yabá focuses on supporting Aeta students—members of one of the Philippines’ earliest indigenous communities—who often face financial hardship, limited access to schools, and cultural barriers that make continuing education difficult. Many Aeta children in Iriga and nearby areas leave school because of transportation costs, lack of materials, or the need to help support their families. To address these challenges, Yabá provides scholarships, school supplies, and holistic support from elementary to college. More than financial aid, the Foundation aims to create an encouraging environment where Aeta youth can thrive academically and personally while celebrating their cultural identity. Working with local schools, community leaders, and partner organizations, Yabá also offers mentorship, leadership activities, and cultural enrichment. Its mission is to help shape confident, capable young Aeta leaders who can uplift their families and communities. The name “Yabá” means loved in the Iriga language—capturing the spirit behind every effort. To date, Yabá has supported 27 students, including 24 high school graduates and 12 college graduates who now serve as teachers, police officers, community leaders, and other valued professionals.
