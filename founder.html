    <p class="founder-description">
        Daughter of Bicol, Advocate of Kindness, the Planet and the Education of Indigenous Youth, Veteran Life Coach, Forest Builder, Philippine Marketing Communications Industry Leader, Meditation Teacher, Student of Life.
<br><br>
        Tracing her roots in Iriga, Bicol, Gigi Tibi is an advocate for kindness, the planet, and the education of indigenous youth. A veteran life coach, forest builder, and student of life, she blends heart and purpose in everything she does.
<br><br>
     A graduate of the University of the Philippines in Communication and Masters in Business Administration, Gigi founded RadManila Communications, a creative agency grounded in compassion, joy and excellence.
<br><br>
     Her love for learning led her to start Yabá—originally a micro-library under a tree. After a typhoon destroyed it, she transformed it into the Yabá Educational Foundation, devoted to empowering Aeta children through education. Since 2017, Yabá has helped produce teachers, engineers, and community leaders.
<br><br>
     Gigi with the help of her family and friends, also helped grow a forest of 2,000 indigenous trees at the foot Mt. Iriga, her act of gratitude to the Earth. As a meditation teacher, she shares her belief that “World peace begins with befriending one’s mind.”
